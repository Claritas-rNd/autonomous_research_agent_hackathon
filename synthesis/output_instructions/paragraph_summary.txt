# Output Specification: `paragraph_summary`

## Purpose
This format is for users who need a compact, high-signal summary that captures the essential insight in a paragraph. It is intended for situations where the user wants enough detail to understand the point, but not a full breakdown. It supports use cases like talking points, internal briefings, or message drafts.

## Format
- A single paragraph formatted in markdown
- No bullet points, subheadings, or citations
- No mention of research steps, sources, or the agent itself

## Length
- Target: 75–100 words
- Maximum: 200 words

## Style
- Clear, direct, and informative
- Prioritize the most important conclusion first, then briefly explain why it matters
- Language and terminology should align with the user’s role, as described in the customer profile
- Avoid qualifiers and uncertainty unless the insight is inconclusive

## Agent Behavior
- Focus on synthesizing, not listing—combine key insights into a unified statement
- Emphasize what the user should know or act on, not how the information was found
- Let the user’s intent, use case, and role determine the tone and emphasis

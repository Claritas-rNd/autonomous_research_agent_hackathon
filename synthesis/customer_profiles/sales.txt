A senior salesperson in an adtech solutions company is accountable for generating revenue through strategic client acquisition, retention, and expansion. Their core objective is to align the company’s offerings with the evolving needs of advertisers, agencies, retailers, and media publishers—translating product capabilities into tangible business outcomes for clients. Unlike marketing or product roles that shape what the company offers, the salesperson ensures those offerings penetrate the market, gain adoption, and convert into measurable revenue growth.

This role’s success is defined by four main objectives. First is market penetration—driving the adoption of the company’s products in key accounts and verticals. Second is revenue growth—not only securing new business but also expanding within existing relationships through upselling and cross-selling. Third is pipeline reliability—ensuring there is a consistent, well-qualified flow of opportunities to support predictable forecasting and strategic planning. Fourth is organizational feedback—acting as a real-time source of customer insights that influence product development, pricing strategy, and go-to-market focus.

To meet these objectives, the salesperson must perform the following day-to-day tasks:
• Identify and qualify leads through outbound efforts, referrals, events, and inbound funnel review.
• Conduct discovery calls to understand a prospect’s goals, challenges, and current solutions.
• Translate product capabilities into clear value propositions that align with prospect needs.
• Build and present custom proposals that define scope, pricing, and projected business outcomes.
• Manage CRM hygiene by updating opportunity stages, deal notes, and forecasting data in real time.
• Collaborate with product, marketing, and customer success to align deal strategy with execution.
• Negotiate contract terms, resolve objections, and secure executive buy-in to close the deal.
• Follow up post-sale to ensure solution delivery matches expectations and identify upsell paths.
• Maintain weekly, monthly, and quarterly pipeline reviews with leadership to refine strategy.
• Capture and relay structured client feedback to inform roadmap decisions and positioning.
• These tasks drive the commercial engine of the business—expanding market share, increasing customer lifetime value, and ensuring the company’s offerings remain relevant and competitive.

A senior marketing leader advances the organization by generating demand, strengthening market position, and equipping commercial teams with the narratives and materials needed to convert prospects into long-term clients. Their role translates complex data and technology offerings into clear, differentiated messages that resonate with advertisers, agencies, and publishers. Marketing doesn’t just drive visibility—it drives qualified pipeline and brand credibility.

This role contributes through four key objectives. First is demand generation—building and executing programs that attract and convert high-quality leads. Second is market positioning—crafting messaging that clearly articulates Claritas’ value and differentiation in a crowded ecosystem. Third is sales enablement—arming go-to-market teams with tools, content, and insights that shorten deal cycles. Fourth is brand trust—ensuring consistency, professionalism, and thought leadership across all external touchpoints.

To achieve these objectives, a senior marketing leader performs the following focused, repeatable tasks:
• Plan and execute multi-channel campaigns to drive awareness, engagement, and lead generation across priority verticals.
• Develop core messaging frameworks and value propositions for products, features, and client segments.
• Create sales collateral, case studies, pitch decks, and battlecards tailored to different buyer personas.
• Coordinate event strategy—industry conferences, webinars, and sponsorships—to elevate brand presence and generate leads.
• Track and report on campaign performance, lead quality, and marketing-attributed revenue using clear KPIs.
• Maintain the company website, blog, and digital properties with timely, SEO-optimized content.
• Oversee PR and analyst relations to increase earned media coverage and third-party validation.
• Collaborate with product and data science teams to turn insights into marketing narratives and client-facing stories.
• Manage the marketing automation stack, CRM integration, and segmentation strategy for targeted outreach.
• Run competitive analysis to refine positioning and anticipate shifts in market messaging.

These objectives ensure that Claritas not only reaches the right audience but does so with clarity, consistency, and commercial impact—making marketing a key driver of revenue growth and long-term brand strength.
